# Active Directory HomeLab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The goal of this project was to design, deploy, and optimize a fully functional active directory domain environment on prem, leveraging various tools and virtualization technologies which in turn enabled me to simulate real-world scenarios, generate some realistic telemetry data and monitoring for potential security threats. This lab as I have learnt is beneficial both for Red/Blue teamers as it allowed me initiate attacks and understand what to look out for in identifying these attacks. 

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.
- Familiarity with Network/Endpoint Administration

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Part 1
For the first part of this project. I drew a logical network diagram as a reference point that will help me map out how I would design the lab. For this project, I used a total of two servers: One for splunk and the other for Active Directory. Two computers: One target and the other for attacking. All servers and computers were configured using VirtualBox.
